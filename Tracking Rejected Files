Instructions for Tracking Rejected Files
(Using an AAP as example)

I. Rejected Paperwork - After data entry is done and documents have been extracted to the Rejected folder you will need to submit each issue in PPRStat.

1.  Extract (and delete from the file you are extracting from) rejected forms from the "In Progress" folder. Put all extracted files into the "Rejected" folder and the leftover completed forms will go into "Completed"

2.  Open up the file you are working on from the "Rejected" folder

3.  After logging into PPRStat, click on Reject forms.

4.  Input all information, if available

    a. Form Type
    b. Facility
    c. Rejection Category
    d. Staff Person
    e. Staff Approval Date


5.  Move to next entry by clicking on “Add Entry” on the bottom right hand corner.

6.  Keep track of rejected form by noting the ID number on the top right and adding it to the PDF using the typewriter function in Adobe.


6.	Update status of rejected form as progress is made in getting the form completed correctly.



7.	Once all rejected paperwork has been entered into PPRStat, print out rejected files. Start by clicking on the finished tab on the top left.
    8.Click “Reject and Print”  followed by generally clicking “Yes” if you want to mark all the forms as returned to the district manager.
    9.Attach each corresponding cover sheet printed out to the corresponding rejected paperwork; make sure to sort by district.
    10.Place each district’s rejected paperwork into their corresponding mailboxes.

II. Getting rejected paperwork back
1.	If the work is returned with corrections, you will follow the normal intake and data entry workflow.
2.	Use PPR STAT to enter the data and correct the entry or create a new entry with the correct information.  
3.	Once a file is completed, hopefully no rejections this time, you will move the file to the "Completed" folder and delete the corresponding PDF from the "Rejections" Folder.
