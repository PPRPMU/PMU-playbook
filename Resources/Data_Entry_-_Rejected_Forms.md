# Rejected Forms

After data entry is completed and the PDF pages have been extracted to the Rejected folder, you will need to submit each issue in PPRStat. (Using AAP as an example)

1.  After logging into PPRstat, click on Reject forms.

     a. Form Type

3.  Once the entry is completed, if you have not entered the rejection type on the PDF file, use the typewriter in Acrobat to do so. Make sure to type the Rejection ID on the PDF as well to show that you have entered the rejection in PPRstat.

4.  Move to next entry by clicking on “Add Entry” on the bottom right hand corner.

5.  Once all rejected paperwork has been entered into PPRStat, print out rejected files and cover sheets. Start by clicking on the finished tab on the top left.

9. Place each district’s rejected paperwork into their corresponding mailboxes.
