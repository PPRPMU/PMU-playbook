6. Enter the name of the participant and mark each day the participant wasn't present (represented by an X on the form). Hit the right arrow button to go to the next participant.

7. When a page is completed, if all the participants were located in PPRstat, use the typewriter function in Acrobat to write down your initials and date in the format: "II 1/1". If there are missing participants, note on the PDF that there are Missing Registrations and use the rectangle tool in acrobat to highlight the missing participants as seen below.After noting the rejection type, continue with data entry, you'll return to all of the rejections after data entry is complete.

8. If any parts above are missing from the application it will be marked as “rejected” at the top of the page with the rejection type noted using the typewriter function (i.e. Missing Registration or Form is illegible). After noting the rejection type, continue with data entry, you'll return to all of the rejections after data entry is complete.
9. Once all forms have been entered, put all completed pages in the Completed folder and all of the rejected pages into the Rejected folder using the same file name (yyyyMMdd).
