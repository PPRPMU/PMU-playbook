## Participant Registration Forms for Summer Camp 2017

1. Find the Youth Participant and Registration (YPRF) PDF file from the current intake in the Backlog. (Files should be named using the date of intake using the format: yyyyMMdd-facility.) Move the current files you are working with into the In Progress folder so that it signifies that someone is working on the file.

2. Open your assigned Excel sheet.

3. To begin the data entry process, first check if the participant is already in the Excel sheet. If the participant is already in the sheet, you will need to change the Program Start Date to 7/1/2017. Once changed, add the Data Entry ID and the current date to the YPRF page on the PDF.

4. If the participant was not found in the excel sheet, you will have to manually add them. 
   - For Summer Camp 2017 participants enter the following if present: First Name, Middle Name, Last Name, Nick Name DOB, Address 1 and 2, Zip Code, Primary Language, Gender, Race, Ethnicity, Email, Home Phone, Cell Phone, and Alerts. 
   - The following should be autopopulated with the correct information as well: Agency, Program Name, Program Start Date, and Data Entry ID.

5. After Entering the information for the participant, make sure to add the Data Entry ID to the PDF as well as the current date to the YPRF page on the PDF.

6. Once completed, make sure all the participants in the PDF have Dates and IDs on them. If everything is completed correctly, save the file and move it to the Completed folder.

7. If any parts above are missing from the registration form it will be marked as “rejected” at the top of the page with the rejection type noted using the typewriter function (i.e. Missing Facility or Missing DOB). After noting the rejection type, continue with data entry, you'll return to all of the rejections after data entry is complete.

8. Once all forms have been entered. Put all completed pages in the Completed folder and all of the rejected pages into the Rejected folder using the same file name (yyyyMMdd-Facility).
