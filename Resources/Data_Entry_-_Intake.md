# Intake

Every Thursday is the start of intake. Intake does not need to start until everything is turned in for the week (usually around noon).

#### For forms with payment:
1. Verify that the payment amount is correct and the payment is filled out correctly (i.e. no missing signature). (See fee schedule if needed.)
2. Write the check number onto the Outdoor Sports Application to make sure you know which form the check is for.
3. Remove paper clips and staples.
4. Compile checks and keep in Andy's office until ready to enter into PPRstat.

#### Everything else:
1. Sort forms by type (AAP, OSP, MAR, YPRF, WAR, ASDS, PSF).
2. Remove paper clips and staples.
3. Scan files in piles grouped by type.
   - If there are a lot of forms for that specific type, generally MARs, split documents in half and combine them later digitally (Highlight files, right click, "Combine supported files in Acrobat").
   - At the xerox click "Workflow Scanning"
     - Change settings to your xerox folder, 2-sided scanning, and change the document name to the format of "yyyymmdd-" + "facility name" for after school programs. Everything else will be named using the format "yyyymmdd". (You can temporarily append something like "aap" to the end of the file name to make it easier to download into the correct folder later.)
4. Open the files from the xerox folder under your name and download them to the shared drive under their respective folders in the backlog.
5. Clean up scans by making sure they are oriented correctly and blank pages are removed. (This can be accomplished using the Pages panel in Adobe Acrobat. Right clicking on the page will give you the options to delete or rotate the page.)
