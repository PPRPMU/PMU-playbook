2. Once you tab over or click a different field a prompt will come up asking if this is a new check. Click "Yes" if yes. (See step 4 if "No")

4. From time to time you will have a check that accounts for more than one permit. When you enter this check for the first permit proceed as normal (Step 3). However, remember to put the full amount of the check in the check's amount (but only put the fee amount in the Fee Amount Paid field). For the second permit, enter the "Fee Amount Paid" and click "No" when asked if this is a new check. Search for the check using the check number, then click "Apply this payment"

5. Sometimes you will have the reverse where two or more check will be used for one permit. In this case, for the first check type in the amount of the first check for the "Fee Amount Paid" field. Once the payment is applied, go into the field again and type in the amount of the total of the check your are entering plus the previous amount and complete as normal.

6. Once everything is entered click "Apply this payment" then click Yes.

7. After all the checks are entered you must print the check log (under "Print Check Log" in PPRstat's main menu).
- For money orders enter the name that is on the money order and if not present write down the name of the permit holder.
- For adults using outdoor fields, payment will be needed. If payment is not attached or incorrect, form will need to be rejected.
- Serial numbers will be given to money orders and are usually longer (7+ characters) than check numbers which are much shorter (2-4 characters);
