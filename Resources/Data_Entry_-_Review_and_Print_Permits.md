3. You will first have to apply a filter on the permits you want to print out. Click "Apply Filter" and enter the Permit ID of the first Outdoor Sports Permit you entered for that week's intake. Enter either the Permit ID of the last Outdoor Sports Permit you entered or round to the next thousand.

7. Look for errors in the data entry by comparing the printed permits to the scanned permit. Make sure to check the Facility, Dates, Amenities, and Schedule. ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PPRPMU/PMU-playbook/master/Images/Data_Entry_-_Review_and_Print_Permits/permit_information.png)

8. When you are checking the count for the permits, note that some of the permits won't print, and in rare cases if a permit has a lot of information it will end up being two pages long.
