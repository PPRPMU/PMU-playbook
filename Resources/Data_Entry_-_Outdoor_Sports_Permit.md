   - For OSP forms, the minimum requirement for entry requires:

     - Activity Type
     - Expected Group Size
     - Application Date
     - Approved Schedule (if blank use requested schedule)
     - Assigned Amenities (if blank use requested facility)
     - Staff Approved Signature and Date

6. If entry is complete, use typewriter function to write the Permit ID on the top of the OSP Form on the PDF file.
7. If any parts above are missing from the application it will be marked as “rejected” at the top of the page with the rejection type noted using the typewriter function (i.e. Missing Expected Group Size or Missing Staff Approval). After noting the rejection type, continue with data entry, you'll return to all of the rejections after data entry is complete.
8. Once all forms have been entered. Put all completed pages in the Completed folder and all of the rejected pages into the Rejected folder using the same file name (yyyyMMdd).



### Tips:

- Ctrl + " will load previous start or end time in the scheduling fields.
- "Load Data From Previous Permit" for returning permits or permits with similar information in the intake, you can enter the permit id, hit enter; most of the top fields will be populated with that permit's information.
- Payments  
  - Fee Schedule: https://github.com/PPRPMU/PMU-playbook/raw/master/Resources/Athletic_Fields_Fee_Schedule_2016.pdf
  - Time-slots don't have rollover hours. For instance, if the rate is $300 for four hours and only two are used, the two hours cannot be used for another two-hour time slot throughout the week. 
  - Children (no fee), Adults (fee), Children and Adults (fee).
  - No fees for courts.
- If an old permit is being revised, find the permit, update the permit in PPRstat, note the Permit ID on the file, and make sure to reprint the permit when sending out the other permits. 
- If you are looking for an old permit it PPRstat, go to the field you want to search for (such as organization name), then hit Ctrl + F, then type in your search term. Make sure to hit any part of field if you are searching for a partial search term (i.e. searching just for "softball" instead of "Philly Softball League").  This search will find permits that have been "Completed" or "In Progress" so if you cannot find permit, use the search function in PPRstat in "Reject Forms" find the facility to narrow down where the PDF would be located in "Rejected" folder in the shared drive.
