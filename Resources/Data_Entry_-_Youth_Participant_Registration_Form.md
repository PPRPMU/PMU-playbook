4. Change the facility to the corresponding set of registrations you are entering. 

5. To begin the data entry process, first check if the participant is already in the system. Click "Enroll Participant in Program" which can be found under "Home" tab. Then search for the participant's name. (Tip: Last name and first letter of first name should suffice. If you have trouble understanding the entire name on the form, search the first few letters of the participant's first and last name)

6. You will then be prompted to a list of names with that last name. Double check that the birthday, name and last name match before clicking on your participant.

7. At the bottom of the screen you will reach a small calendar icon. Enter the date of the start of the program. (Most summer camps start on the first Monday after the 4th of July. In this case we have selected 7/5/2016) Once you have selected the date, click the "Enroll Participant" button.
