## Naming image file rules:

1. File name should be short, descriptive, use full words or abbreviations. (e.g. "ppr_logo" or "parks_and_rec_logo", not "prksnrec_lgo")

2. Use underscores instead of spaces.

3. Use lowercase letters.

4. Images will be put into a folder: which will be named by its corresponding file. (e.g. file Data_Entry_-_Outdoor_Sports_Permit will use images from folder image/Data_Entry_-_Outdoor_Sports_Permit )
